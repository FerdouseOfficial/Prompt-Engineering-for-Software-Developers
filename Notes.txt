 Best practices ===============

    1. Clear Instructions
    2. Adopt a persona
    3. Specify the format
    4. Avoid leading the answer
    5. Limit the scope

⌨️ (31:20) Zero shot and few shot prompts

there is not that much of complexity in this concepts okay;

Zero Shots Prompting:- 
    In zero shot prompting way you just provide a prompt which answer is already exist you don't need to feed any data for it. You can get the answer from the prompt.

Few Shot Prompting:-
    In few shot prompting way, By only asking or providing a prompt the models will not able to answer that You must feed some information give some context about that concepts the question you are asking or. That is called the few shot prompting.

⌨️ (35:06) AI hallucinations

    An AI hallucination is when a large language model (LLM) generates false information.
    its actually that SIMPLE

⌨️ (36:43) Vectors/text embeddings

    In computer science, particularly in the realm of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), text embedding is a popular technique to represent textual information in a format that can be easily processed by algorithms, especially deep learning models.

That's all 


If you want me to explain this:- 
                                        ------------------------------------------------
                                                here is how I will explain this
                                        ------------------------------------------------

Actually when we talk about Prompt Engineering; People who don't have any kind of idea about it. They think this are some kind of technical thing like Engineering. Because its includes the Engineering word with it.

but actually if we wanna know what is Prompt Engineering we don't need have fancy educational qualification. Any one can understand it very easily.

Prompt Engineering is like instead of giving a misleading, undecorated and unplanned Instruction, It is the way of writing clear and effective prompt(instruction) for the machine. It's as easy as like that okay.

I think for me this line above is more then enough for me to recap and revise or making people understand okay.
